### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Keep watching all my repos regularly and keep forking... Keep hit star icons for the repos you like :)

## Principles
### Humans come first
Any team Iâ€™ve ever worked on delivered a product with help from many people, both within the team and outside it. My goal is to empower these people to be productive, achieve their goals, and get out of their way. Technology comes and goes but people remain at the core of everything that I do.

### Feedback helps everyone be better
Without feedback itâ€™s very easy to fall back into oneâ€™s comfort zone and be unaware of weaknesses or issues. I ask for feedback frequently and from different parts of an organization. Donâ€™t be surprised if I ask you for it as well.

I am also not stingy with providing feedback. If there is something that bothers me or I think has room for improvement, I will have that conversation
