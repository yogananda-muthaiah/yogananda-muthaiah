### Hi there 👋

Keep watching all my repos regularly and keep forking... Keep hit star icons for the repos you like :)

## Principles
### Humans come first
Any team I’ve ever worked on delivered a product with help from many people, both within the team and outside it. My goal is to empower these people to be productive, achieve their goals, and get out of their way. Technology comes and goes but people remain at the core of everything that I do.

### Feedback helps everyone be better
Without feedback it’s very easy to fall back into one’s comfort zone and be unaware of weaknesses or issues. I ask for feedback frequently and from different parts of an organization. Don’t be surprised if I ask you for it as well.

I am also not stingy with providing feedback. If there is something that bothers me or I think has room for improvement, I will have that conversation

## Leadership and knowledge see no level boundaries
Looking at titles to determine whether the person is knowledgeable or has the right perspective is counterproductive. I treat everyone as someone who is extremely smart, passionate about solving complex problems, knows more than I do, and is looking to make the products and experiences I work on better.

## Bias for action
I prefer us setting up an A/B test or look at data instead of endlessly debating what’s right in never-ending meetings.

When there are resource constraints, I look at ways to get around those constraints by leveraging my skills and the skills of those around me. When there is no data, gut feel is fine - it helps us get started and be able to learn quickly. I’d rather learn by putting bits in front of customers than hypothesize with no end in sight about a perfect solution.

## A great customer solution is the goal
I don’t believe in having “turfs” or “areas of influence.” Empire building is a sure-fire recipe for mediocrity at best and failure at worst.
